ScriptCaddy is a specialized IDE for cataloging, developing and running short throwaway or regularly useful scripts. How data gets in and out of a script is handled by I/O (input/output) fields configured within the app so you can immediately focus on your script's logic. ScriptCaddy also keeps all of your scripts in one place so they never get lost.

Need to quickly convert some JSON to CSV? Need to convert a unix timestamp to ISO 8601? Need to build a URL from some set of data inputs? Put ScriptCaddy in your developer's toolbelt and reach for it whenever you need it.

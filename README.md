# ScriptCaddy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/frank-weindel/scriptcaddy.svg?token=ido4ncmx4xST7dTszKWQ&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/frank-weindel/scriptcaddy)

ScriptCaddy is a simple IDE designed for developing and running task scripts that a developer may need in their day-to-day role in software development. A task script can be something you write and run regularly to perform a particular function (like a script that converts a Unix timestamp to a human readable form), or something that you write quickly once to do a task and then never use again (i.e. throw away scripts). ScriptCaddy simplifies how you get data in and out of your scripts, so you never have to fumble around with command line parameters or reading and writing files every time you need to write a simple task. The ultimate goal is to provide a concrete home for your library of task scripts and keep them cognitively separate from the application code you write in other IDEs. With that it becomes a highly customizable multi-tool that you keep on your programmer's tool belt that you can reach for whenever you need it.

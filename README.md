ScriptCaddy is a specialized IDE for cataloging, developing and running short throwaway or regularly useful scripts. How data gets in and out of a script is handled by I/O (input/output) fields configured within the app so you can immediately focus on the script's logic.

## Feature Roadmap

* Provide interface for installing/uninstalling external packages (npm packages)
* Better themes
* New I/O field features and types
  * Easily load inputs from files or save outputs to files
  * Simple field validations (numbers only, JSON, password)
  * Dropdowns, check boxes, radio buttons
  * GUI editor for I/O config
* Global library of scripts you can download from and contribute to
* Support Python and other scripting runtimes
* Internationalization / Localization
